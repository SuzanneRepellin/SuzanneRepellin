### Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a 30 yo software developer
- After studying for three years at the 42 school in Lyon for 3 years, I have been a freelance developer for now 2 years.
- As a freelance, I mostly worked on webapps in C# using the .NET framework, and JavaScript/jQuery for front
- I also taught php, Symfony and JavaScript to young adults wth disabilities
- I did most of my school projects in C language
- Other than that, I'm proficient in JavaScript, C++ and Python
- I want to gain proficiency in JavaScript Frameworks in order to broaden my horizons as to what projects I can work on
- I also have some experience in Rust and would love an opportunity to practice it more
- I am looking for projects that make sense to me and resonate with my core values - human rights, solidarity and equality

Keep in ming that most of the projects here were written as I was starting to learn code! I keep them as they are a good witness of my curve progression, and show the kind of exercises that are given to 42 students just a few month after their admission.

Do no hesitate to contact me if you have any question or project you would like to offer on.
