### Welcome to my github profile ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a 28 yo software developer
- After studying for three years at the 42 school in Lyon, I am now looking for freelance opportunity
- I did most of my projects in C language
- I worked in C# using .NET and .NET Core frameworks
- I am currently using php Symfony for a freelance mission
- Other than that, I'm proficient in C++, Python and JavaScript
- I have some experience in Rust and would love an opportunity to practice it more


Feel free to roam my repositories to get to know my work. 

Keep in ming that the C projects were written as I was starting to learn code ! I keep them as they are a good witness of my progression, and show the kind of exercises that are asked from 42 students just a few month after their admission.

Do no hesitate to contact me if you have any question or project you would like to offer me to work on.
